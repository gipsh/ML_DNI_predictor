# ML_DNI_predictor
Predicts the DOB of a person based on his/her DNI using neural network regression model 

The dataset was taken from [here](https://www.unc.edu.ar/sites/default/files/LISTADO%20%20BECARIOS%20FU%202017_web.xls)

Current model has an error mean of ~4 years but it can be easily improved with more training and some tweaking 

## Collab notebook

All is implemented in collab, check [ML_Test_DNI_Predictor.ipynb](https://github.com/gipsh/ML_DNI_predictor/blob/main/ML_Test_DNI_Predictor.ipynb)
